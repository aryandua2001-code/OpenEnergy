## Cinematic Hero — Scroll-Driven Frame Sequence

### Architecture
The hero is a `<canvas>` element inside a sticky wrapper. Scrolling through 5×100svh of scroll space (the "scroll spacer") advances through 240 WebP frames, giving a video-like cinematic effect.

### Frame loading
- **Format:** WebP (converted from source JPGs via `cwebp -q 82` — 67MB → 33MB, 51% reduction)
- **Pre-decoding:** `img.decode()` called after each `img.onload` — forces the browser to decompress into raw pixels before the frame is needed, so `drawImage()` is instant (no JIT decode stutter)
- **Lazy by chapter:** loads chapter 0 (frames 0–47) first, then chains chapters 1–4 sequentially in background. Initial load ~7MB instead of 33MB
- **Fallback:** if a frame isn't loaded yet, `drawFrame()` walks outward and draws the nearest available frame — canvas never goes blank on slow connections

### Frame file naming
`/frames/frame_0001.webp` → `/frames/frame_0240.webp` (1-indexed, 4-digit zero-padded)

### Chapter boundaries (scroll progress 0→1)
```js
{ start: 0.10, end: 0.30 }  // Ch01 · Generation — India needs 10GW solar/yr
{ start: 0.30, end: 0.50 }  // Ch02 · Storage — Solar without storage is half a solution
{ start: 0.50, end: 0.70 }  // Ch03 · Manufacturing — Cell to container, end-to-end
{ start: 0.70, end: 0.90 }  // Ch04 · Deployment — 50MW/100MWh, Rajasthan
{ start: 0.90, end: 1.00 }  // Ch05 · CTA — Build your park with us
```

### Scroll engine
- **Lenis** (`lerp: 0.12`, `autoRaf: false`) drives smooth scroll for the full page
- GSAP ticker feeds Lenis: `gsap.ticker.add((time) => lenis.raf(time * 1000))`
- `lenis.on('scroll', ScrollTrigger.update)` keeps GSAP ScrollTrigger in sync

### Chapter-by-chapter navigation
Each scroll gesture plays the entire current chapter (snap point to snap point) and locks. Implementation:

```
Snap points: [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]  (one per chapter boundary)
```

1. **Wheel listener** (`capture: true`, `passive: false`) fires before Lenis
2. `e.stopImmediatePropagation()` prevents Lenis from accumulating deltaY on hard scrolls
3. `goToChapter(index)` plays the canvas frames with a GSAP time-based tween from the current snap progress to the target snap progress (`duration: 0.72`, `ease: 'none'`)
4. At completion, Lenis is moved to the exact snap pixel with `lenis.scrollTo(target, { immediate: true })`. This keeps the scroll state correct without tying the final visual frames to a slow easing tail.
5. The input lock uses a short momentum drain: every intercepted wheel/touch event updates `lastInputAt`, and the chapter unlocks once input has been quiet for 140ms and at least 120ms have passed since the visual tween completed. This absorbs OS momentum tails without swallowing the user's next intentional scroll.
6. When at last snap going down → no intercept → Lenis handles normal page scroll

**Why this shape:** earlier versions animated the real scroll position with `lenis.scrollTo(duration + easing)`. Even when technically smooth, the easing approached zero velocity near the target, so the image sequence appeared to lag for the last fraction of a second. The current version decouples visual frame playback from scroll easing: frames advance at constant speed, then the real scroll position is snapped into place invisibly while the sticky hero is already on the correct final frame.

### Canvas rendering
- DPR capped at 2× (`Math.min(devicePixelRatio, 2)`) — prevents 3× retina creating 9× canvas memory (iOS crash fix)
- `ctx.drawImage(img, x, y, w, h)` with cover-fit scaling
- `desynchronized: true` on context for lower-latency draws

## Animations

| System | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Hero entrance | GSAP stagger: tagline words (0.12s stagger), sub (0.65s delay), scroll hint (1.3s delay) |
| Hero fade | Opacity 0 over first 10% of cinematic scroll progress |
| Chapter overlays | CSS `opacity: 0→1` transition (0.15s) toggled by scroll progress check in `lenis.on('scroll')` |
| Scroll reveals | `.reveal` class (opacity 0, translateY 30px) → GSAP ScrollTrigger `start: 'top 88%'` |
| About visual | Pure CSS — glow orb pulses, 3 rings rotate at different speeds |
| Navbar | `.scrolled` class toggled at `scrollY > 50` → frosted glass background |

## Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Changes |
|---|---|
| `≤900px` (tablet) | Nav links hidden, grids → 1 col, section padding reduced, manu/rfp grids stack |
| `≤600px` (mobile) | Single-column everywhere, typography via `clamp()`, manu flow arrows rotate 90°, contact strips stack, nav simplified to logo+CTA only |

`overflow-x: hidden` on `body` only (not `html` — iOS Safari breaks scroll context if set on html).

## Contact Form

Client-side only — no backend. Submit button shows "Message Sent ✓" for 3 seconds then resets. Fields: Full name, company, email, phone, inquiry type (Solar EPC / BESS EPC / Hybrid / C&I / Sub-EPC / Supply), capacity, project state (all major solar states), target COD, message.

## Dev Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Vite dev server on localhost:3000
npm run build    # Production build → dist/

```

## Deployment

- **Auto-deploy:** push to `main` → Netlify detects → rebuilds in ~60s → live at openenergy.in
- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Publish dir:** `dist/`
- **DNS:** GoDaddy nameservers → Netlify; SSL auto-provisioned via Let's Encrypt

## Git notes

- Videos gitignored (`public/videos/`, `videos/`) — too large for GitHub
- WebP frames ARE committed (33MB total, within GitHub limits)
- `git config http.postBuffer 524288000` required for initial push (large binary files)
